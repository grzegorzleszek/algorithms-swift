algorithms-swift  
===================

Library for graph algorithms which allow a fast algorithm computation for graph problems.

----------

Breadth-first search
-------------

In graph theory a breadth first search algorithm is used for searching for a specific node of a given graph or visiting all nodes of a graph. 

1.  Initialize: open=[Start]; closed=[]
2.  while open â‰  [] do
3.  begin
4. 	 remove the left most from open, call it X;
5.	 if X is a goal then return(success);
6.	 generate all children of X;
7.	 put X on closed;
8.	 eliminate any children of X already on either open or closed, as these will cause loops in the search;
9.	 put the remaining descendants, in order of discovery, on the right end of open;
10. end.

Complexity O( |V| + |E| )
